# Assignly - Task Management


**Project overview:**

Assignly is a mobile web app built on Angular's Ionic framework that works across platforms. Being a decent task management app, users can create, read, update and delete tasks in real-time. Its ability to load previously fetched data when there is no internet connection is one of the main features and this combined with being able to access the latest data makes offline and online experience has never been better.

The aim of the project is to design a efficient digital task management system that addresses the limitations of manual tracking. Assignly leverages Firebase integration, real-time synchronization to streamline workflows, maintain data consistency, and allow users to track progress on tasks transparently.
